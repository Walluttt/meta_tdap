# Truck-to-dock Door Assignment Problem (TDAP)

## Data
- folder `didactic` contains didactic datafiles 
- folder `singleObjective2016` contains the datafiles generated by Gelareh et al.

## Run the code
- download all the repository from GitHub
- in a terminal, move inside the subdirectory `dev` and invoke `julia`
- in the REPL, invoke `include("TDAP_main.jl")`

## Setup the code
Edit the file `TDAP_main.jl` and modify it as follow:

### Switch between a single instance and a collection of instance
- `experiment = false`   to perform one instance
- `experiment = true`    to perform all the instances

### Select GLPK as MIP solver
- `using GLPK`                   to enable GLPK as MIP solver
- `#using Gurobi`                to disable Gurobi as MIP solver
- `IPsolver = GLPK.Optimizer`    to select GLPK 

### Select Gurobi as MIP solver
- `using Gurobi`                 to enable Gurobi as MIP solver
- `#using GLPK`                  to disable GLPK as MIP solver
- `IPsolver = Gurobi.Optimizer`  to select Gurobi 

### Set display on or off
- `display = true`      output information in the terminal
- `display = false`     output nothing

### Set graphics on or off
- `graphic = true`      output information graphically
- `graphic = false`     output nothing
