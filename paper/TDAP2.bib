abstract = {Cross-docking is a logistics strategy in which freight is unloaded from inbound vehicles and (almost) directly loaded into outbound vehicles, with little or no storage in between. This paper presents an overview of the cross-docking concept. Guidelines for the successful use and implementation of cross-docking are discussed and several characteristics are described that can be used to distinguish between different cross-dock types. In addition, this paper presents an extensive review of the existing literature about cross-docking. The discussed papers are classified based on the problem type that is tackled (ranging from more strategic or tactical to more operational problems). Based on this review, several opportunities to improve and extend the current research are indicated.}

abstract = {Abstract A major challenge in making supply meet demand is to coordinate transshipments across the supply chain to reduce costs and increase service levels in the face of demand fluctuations, short lead times, warehouse limitations, and transportation and inventory costs. In particular, transshipment through crossdocks, where just-in-time objectives prevail, requires precise scheduling between suppliers, crossdocks, and customers. In this work, we study the transshipment problem with supplier and customer time windows where flow is constrained by transportation schedules and warehouse capacities. Transportation is provided by fixed or flexible schedules and lot-sizing is dealt with through multiple shipments. We develop polynomial-time algorithms or, otherwise, provide the complexity of the problems studied. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2005},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider a truck dock assignment problem with an operational time constraint in crossdocks where the number of trucks exceeds the number of docks available. The problem feasibility is affected by three factors: the arrival and departure time window of each truck, the operational time for cargo shipment among the docks, and the total capacity available to the crossdock. The objective is to find an optimal assignment of trucks that minimizes the operational cost of the cargo shipments and the total number of unfulfilled shipments at the same time. We combine the above two objectives into one term: the total cost, a sum of the total dock operational cost and the penalty cost for all the unfulfilled shipments. The problem is then formulated as an integer programming (IP) model. We find that as the problem size grows, the IP model size quickly expands to an extent that the ILOG CPLEX Solver can hardly manage. Therefore, two meta-heuristic approaches, Tabu Search (TS) and genetic algorithm (GA), are proposed. Computational experiments are conducted, showing that meta-heuristics, especially the Tabu search, dominate the CPLEX Solver in nearly all test cases adapted from industrial applications.}

abstract = {A cross docking facility is a type of warehouse in supply chain management that allows orders to be prepared with or without going through the phase of storing products in the warehouse and subsequently selecting them for delivery. The goods are unloaded from incoming trucks called origins on inbound doors of a cross-docking facility platform and, using a handling device inside the platform such as a forklift, immediately transferred to outbound doors to be loaded into outgoing trucks named destinations or delivery trucks for distribution to customers. Contrary to a traditional warehouse, goods are unloaded and loaded without placing them in temporary storage inside the cross-docking facility. The goal of the cross-docking assignment problem (CDAP) is to assign origins to inbound doors and destinations to outbound doors so that the total cost inside the cross-dock platform is minimized. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations of the CDAP in the literature. We propose eight new MIP models and demonstrate the mathematical equivalence of all 11 models, together with rigorously proving some of their properties. In order to detect which of these 11 models is best, we conduct an extensive comparative analysis on benchmark instances from the literature, which discloses that the best model is one proposed in this paper for the first time.}

More specifically, this problem is the subproblem of more involved problems with additional constraints and criteria. We propose a new integer programming model for this problem. The dimension of the polytope associated with the proposed model is identified by introducing a systematic way of generating linearly independent feasible solutions. Several classes of valid inequalities are also introduced. Some of them are proved to be facet-defining. Then, exact separation algorithms are described for separating cuts for classes with exponential number of constraints, and an efficient branch-and-cut algorithm solving real-life size instances in a reasonable time is provided. In most cases, the optimal solution is identified at the root node without requiring any branching.}

The review indicates that there is no standard formulation, that passenger oriented objectives are most common, and that more recent work are multi-objective. In terms of solution methods, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are dominant which provides an opportunity to develop exact and approximate approaches both for the single and multi-objective problems.}

An efficient LP-based heuristic is proposed to solve the biobjective generalized assignment problem (BiGAP). Extensive computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed approach is able to generate good approximations to the nondominated frontier of the BiGAP efficiently, especially when the ratio of the number of items to the number of knapsacks is large.}

Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience. }
